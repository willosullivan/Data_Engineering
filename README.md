# Data_Engineering

Space to pursue my interests in Data Engineering. 

Current files involve accessing SQL Server table with SQLAlchemy, performing numeruous data quality checks with PyTest, and loading this table into newely created  Postgres database.

I will continue building projects from this base in time.
